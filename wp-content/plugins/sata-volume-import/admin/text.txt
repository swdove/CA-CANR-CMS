<narrative type="sidelights">
<para>Diana Abu-Jaber was born in New York state, the daughter of an American
mother and a Jordanian father. The family lived in New York until Diana was
seven years old; at that time they moved to Annan, the capital of Jordan. In
the ensuing years, they moved frequently back and forth between the two
countries. Abu-Jaber recounted her own story in the memoir <title>
<emphasis n="1">The Language of Baklava,</emphasis>
</title> published in
2005.</para>
<para>Abu-Jaber once told <emphasis n="1">CA:</emphasis> &ldquo;I began
writing in order to constitute myself&mdash;as the child of Arab
immigrants&mdash;as a &lsquo;whole&rsquo; person. Writing is wonderfully
healing.&rdquo; In an interview with Jennifer Haupt in <emphasis n="1">
Psychology Today Online,</emphasis> Abu-Jaber noted that her novels usually
take three years each to write. She further remarked on her penchant for
writing at night and by hand: &ldquo;I have a little book light that I&apos;ll
turn on when I can&apos;t sleep and I can often peck out a couple extra
paragraphs in my writing notebook that way. I also write all my novel first
drafts longhand, which seems to amaze my technology-loving students. But I
feel like I trust that writing more somehow&mdash;longhand slows me down,
forces me to be more careful and to think more, to imagine more deeply. And I
like the sensation of my hand against the paper, the feeling of being
physically linked to the act of writing, from mind to fingers to
ink.&rdquo;</para>
<head n="5">
<emphasis n="1">The Language of Baklava</emphasis>
</head>
<para>
<title>
<emphasis n="1">The Language of Baklava,</emphasis>
</title> is
&ldquo;a feast of words and images,&rdquo; according to <emphasis n="1">
Entertainment Weekly</emphasis> reviewer Allyssa Lee. The center of the memoir
is Abu-Jaber&apos;s father, Bud, who left Jordan of his own accord, but finds
himself lost in American culture. He shifts restlessly between Jordan and the
United States, unable to settle in either country. Bud is passionate about
food, a quality he passes on to his daughter. <title>
<emphasis n="1">The
Language of Baklava</emphasis>
</title> is replete with descriptions of meals
and food and even includes numerous recipes.</para>
<para>Gillian Engberg, reviewing <title>
<emphasis n="1">The Language of
Baklava</emphasis>
</title> for <emphasis n="1">Booklist,</emphasis> found it
not only readable but thought-provoking, raising questions about identity and
the meaning of &ldquo;home.&rdquo; Engberg concluded: &ldquo;Abu-Jaber&apos;s
sly, poetic precision will leave readers breathless.&rdquo; A <emphasis n="1">
Kirkus Reviews</emphasis> contributor also had praise for this memoir, noting
that &ldquo;Abu-Jaber&apos;s tales are equally powerful and lovely in their
imagery,&rdquo; and a <emphasis n="1">Publishers Weekly</emphasis> commended
these &ldquo;charming stories of &lsqb;Abu-Jaber&apos;s&rsqb; upbringing in
upstate New York&mdash;with occasional interludes in Jordan,&rdquo; which are
intermingled with good food and recipes.</para>
<head n="5">
<emphasis n="1">The Language of Baklava</emphasis> and
<emphasis n="1">Arabian Jazz</emphasis>
</head>
<para>Though fiction, Abu-Jaber&apos;s first novel <title>
<emphasis n="1">
Arabian Jazz</emphasis>
</title> drew heavily on her own background. The main
characters are Jemorah and Melvina Ramoud, two sisters who have emigrated with
their father from Jordan to Syracuse, following the death of their American
mother. There, they mingle with various colorful family members including Aunt
Fatima the matchmaker.</para>
<para>A <emphasis n="1">Publishers Weekly</emphasis> reviewer found that the
portrayal of Jemorah and Melvina&apos;s family &ldquo;borders on
caricature,&rdquo; but nevertheless praised the author&apos;s &ldquo;narrative
powers.&rdquo; <emphasis n="1">People</emphasis> contributor Louisa Ermelino
noted that Abu-Jaber &ldquo;renders the people poignantly.&rdquo;</para>
<head n="5">
<emphasis n="1">Crescent</emphasis>
</head>
<para>In her next novel, <title>
<emphasis n="1">Crescent,</emphasis>
</title>
Abu-Jaber gives readers a romance set in &ldquo;Teherangeles,&rdquo; the area
of Los Angeles that is home to many Middle Eastern expatriates. The central
location is Nadia&apos;s Caf&eacute;, a Lebanese restaurant. The cook at
Nadia&apos;s is Sirine, an Iraqi-American whose pale-skinned, blond appearance
causes her to feel like an outsider in her own world. She is drawn to Hanif,
an Iraqi intellectual. Sirine&apos;s story is interwoven with an ancient fable
recounting the adventures of Abdelrahman Salahadin, a slave who escaped his
master.</para>
<para>The story makes references to the real-life regime of Saddam Hussein,
from which Hanif fled; but as Ron Charles noted in a review for the
<emphasis n="1">Christian Science Monitor,</emphasis> &ldquo;Abu-Jaber
broadens her exploration of exile to include all the various ways we&apos;re
bereft of home&mdash;by the death of parents, the separation from lovers, the
hunger for lost childhood.&rdquo; Beth Kephart, reviewing the novel for
<emphasis n="1">Book,</emphasis> called it &ldquo;gorgeously written and
deeply imagined.&rdquo;</para>
<head n="5">
<emphasis n="1">Origin</emphasis>
</head>
<para>Abu-Jaber&apos;s 2007 work, <title>
<emphasis n="1">Origin,</emphasis>
</title> is a literary mystery featuring a female fingerprint expert with a
past that haunts her. Lena Dawson made the newspapers when she helped solved a
child-murder case a few years before the events of <title>
<emphasis n="1">
Origin.</emphasis>
</title> Thus, when a baby is found dead in its crib and the
distressed mother refuses to believe the police verdict of sudden infant death
syndrome, the mother contacts Lena. Discovering traces of poison in the
baby&apos;s body, and with several other local babies later found dead, Lena
knows she is on the trail of a killer. Troubling for her, however, are early
childhood memories that go back to the time she was taken into foster care,
when, the victim of a plane crash, she was raised in the jungle for two years
by apes. This has left her with an acute sense of smell and almost clairvoyant
insight and instincts. A young detective works with Lena in the investigation,
and soon they know they are working to stop the killer from taking not only
the lives of more babies, but also Lena&apos;s life, as she begins to sense
that she is being stalked.</para>
<para>
<title>
<emphasis n="1">Origin</emphasis>
</title> won widespread critical
acclaim. Writing in <emphasis n="1">School Library Journal,</emphasis> Ellen
Bell dubbed it &ldquo;gripping&rdquo; and a &ldquo;haunting mystery.&rdquo; A
<emphasis n="1">Kirkus Reviews</emphasis> contributor felt that the author
&ldquo;transcends formula, weaving the whodunit in prose as evocative as
poetry&rdquo; in this &ldquo;haunted, moving crime fiction.&rdquo; Similar
praise came from a <emphasis n="1">Publishers Weekly</emphasis> reviewer who
noted: &ldquo;This enthralling puzzle will appeal to both crime fans and
readers of literary fiction,&rdquo; and from <emphasis n="1">
Booklist</emphasis> writer Donna Seaman, who concluded: &ldquo;Readers seeking
gorgeously rendered fiction as well as intelligent and atmospheric mysteries
will find <title>
<emphasis n="1">Origin</emphasis>
</title>
extraordinary.&rdquo; However, <emphasis n="1">New York Times Book
Review</emphasis> contributor Brian Hall was not convinced by the police
procedural aspects of the crime novel. Hall complained of a number of
&ldquo;implausibilities,&rdquo; including the fact that the police were unable
to detect the poison in the baby and then trace it to telltale elements in the
baby murders. Hall noted: &ldquo;The impression one gets from <title>
<emphasis n="1">Origin</emphasis>
</title> is that the police-detective
elements don&apos;t interest Abu-Jaber enough to induce her to take them
seriously.&rdquo;</para>
<head n="5">
<emphasis n="1">Birds of Paradise</emphasis>
</head>
<para>
<title>
<emphasis n="1">Birds of Paradise,</emphasis>
</title> Abu-
Jaber&apos;s 2011 work of fiction, looks at family relationships gone askew.
At thirteen, Felice Muir ran away from home, in part out of a sense of guilt
and atonement over a joke that went horribly wrong. She has been on the
streets of Miami for five years; a stunningly beautiful girl, she sometimes
makes money modeling. At intervals, she meets with her mother; however, mostly
she spends her time doing drugs and alcohol with her homeless crew of friends.
In the meantime, the other three members of her family&mdash;mother Avis, a
pastry chef, father Brian, a lawyer, and brother Stanley, owner of an organic
market&mdash;all try to deal with her loss by focusing on their work. However,
the loss of Felice has affected the entire family and ultimately distanced
each of them from the other. The novel is set as Felice is about to celebrate
her eighteenth birthday, and is told from multiple perspectives in alternating
chapters that give insight into the real reasons for the daughter&apos;s
departure.</para>
<para>
<emphasis n="1">Library Journal</emphasis> contributor Joy Humphrey
found this &ldquo;literary family drama &hellip; exceptionally written.&rdquo;
<emphasis n="1">Booklist</emphasis> reviewer Kristine Huntley also commended
this fourth novel from Abu-Jaber, calling it &ldquo;nuanced and deftly
written.&rdquo; In like fashion, a <emphasis n="1">Publishers Weekly</emphasis>
writer felt this a &ldquo;stunning portrayal of a damaged family&rdquo; as
well as a &ldquo;satisfying and timely story.&rdquo; For a <emphasis n="1">
Kirkus Reviews</emphasis> contributor, <title>
<emphasis n="1">Birds of
Paradise</emphasis>
</title> is at once a &ldquo;meticulous, deeply moving
portrayal of imperfect human beings struggling to do right&rdquo; and a
&ldquo;provocative exploration of the fault lines of loyalty and guilt.&rdquo;
A more mixed assessment came from <emphasis n="1">New York Times Book
Review</emphasis> writer Cristina Garcia, who thought that the
&ldquo;indisputable stars of <title>
<emphasis n="1">Birds of
Paradise</emphasis>
</title> are Felice and Miami itself.&rdquo; Garcia added:
&ldquo;Abu-Jaber has captured Miami&apos;s insiders and outsiders, the
ordinary and the outlandish, the hype, the hurricanes, the hoopla. This,
perhaps, is her greatest achievement in a novel of mixed success.&rdquo;</para>
