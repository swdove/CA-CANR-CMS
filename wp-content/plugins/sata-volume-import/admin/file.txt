<narrative type="sidelights">
&lt;p&gt;Jesse Ball is a poet and writer, the author of well-received volumes
of verse and prose_ Ball, who earned his M_F_A_ from Columbia University,
has lived and worked in France, Scotland, Iceland, and the United States in
New York City and Chicago, and includes writings about each of those locales
in his 2011 collection &lt;strong&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The Village on Horseback: Prose
and Verse, 2003-2008_&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt; He is also the author of three novels, &lt;strong&gt;
<em>Samedi the Deafness,&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The Way
through Doors,&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The Curfew_&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt; In
an interview with &lt;em&gt;Millions&lt;/em&gt; Web site contributor
Alexandra Beggs, Ball remarked on what he wants to achieve with his writing:
&#x201c;Sometimes people will talk about my books as being experimental, but
they're not_ They might appear to be experimental because they look a little
different, but they're quite old-fashioned especially in the responsibilities
I take in regards to telling the story_ I think that the responsibility that
the storyteller has in reaching the audience is an ancient one, and is very
important_ &#x2026; I think transparency is always good_&#x201d;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ball was widely praised for his first book-length poetry collection,
titled &lt;strong&gt;
&lt;em&gt;March Book_&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt; In the book's
foreword, Richard Howard noted that an &#x201c;indicator of visionary gifts
is indeed vision, what the poet &lt;em&gt;sees&lt;/em&gt; and makes
us see through his eyes_&#x201d; Howard went on to write in his foreword to
the collection that, in many of the author's poems, &#x201c;vision is one term
of a dialectic with what will not or cannot be seen: to observe something
is to posit what escapes observation_ This is the tension that generates most
of Jesse Ball's poems, and it is a fruitful anxiety_&#x201d;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ball collaborated with his wife, Thordis Bj&#xf6;rnsdottir, to write &lt;strong&gt;
<em>Vera &#x26; Linus,&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt; a collection of short prose and
drawings that focuses on the protagonists of Vera and Linus, two friends or
lovers who have a wicked outlook on life, epitomized by an episode in which
they go out with a knife and a bag in search of children's hands_ Torturing
children and animals is not all that Vera and Linus like to do; they also,
at times, are extremely cruel to each other_&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Woodland Pattern&lt;/em&gt; Web site contributor Rob
Baumann commented that the authors &#x201c;excel in understatement and whimsy,
but their greatest achievement is in rendering the perverse and the drab in
a single turn of phrase_&#x201d; Several reviewers noted that Vera and Linus
live in a twisted world that is fairytale-like in nature_ &#x201c;The light
touch and often archaic feel of the prose owes as much to Kafka as to classic
fairy tales,&#x201d; wrote a &lt;em&gt;Publishers Weekly&lt;/em&gt; contributor_
Referring to &lt;strong&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Vera &#x26; Linus&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt; as
&#x201c;Brothers Grimm, Marquis de Sade, Peter Pan and Georges Perec,&#x201d;
Laird Hunt, writing on the &lt;em&gt;Rain Taxi&lt;/em&gt; Web site,
called the book a &#x201c;strangely sexy, agreeably scary collaborative compendium_&#x201d;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ball's first novel, &lt;strong&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Samedi the Deafness,&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt; received
widespread interest and praise from reviewers_ &#x201c;The novel itself is
being described as a &#x2018;mnemonist trapped in a sanatorium for chronic
liars,&#x2019;&#x201d; wrote Shane Jones on the &lt;em&gt;Hobart&lt;/em&gt; Web
site_ &#x201c;Characters lie to one another constantly throughout, the stark
pages alternate from lyrical prose, to sprawling dialog, to the actual notes
the characters leave for one another in the sanatorium_&#x201d; Another reviewer,
writing on the &lt;em&gt;Here She Be&#x2014;The Battlements&lt;/em&gt; Web
site, noted: &#x201c;[Ball's] work has been called Kafka meets Hitchcock or
Ian Fleming, and true to form he weaves a strong but twisted plot, knit tightly
around the central character, James Sim_&#x201d;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The novel begins with a suicide on the White House lawn followed by
Sim's discovery in a park of a man crumpled on the ground and stabbed in the
chest_ As Sim attends to the man, whose name is McHale, he dies, but not before
uttering what he calls a confession, which ends with the word &#x201c;Samedi_&#x201d;
Over the next several days, Sim investigates the murder of McHale and soon
confronts a man named Estrainger, who is his only lead_ However, Estrainger
jumps from a window to his death_ Sim then begins to make connections between
the two suicides and the death of McHale because all of the dead men were
carrying written threats from a revolutionary calling himself &#x201c;Samedi_&#x201d;
Sim is helped in his investigation by the fact that he is mnemonist, that
is, he has an amazing memory that allows him to remember huge amounts of information_
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually Sim is kidnapped by McHale's doppelganger and taken to a
&#x201c;verisylum,&#x201d; which is a mysterious treatment center for chronic
liars_ Once there, Sim seems to recognize another inmate named Grieve, who
thinks she is Anastasia and later Lily Violet, and who may or may not have
a look-alike of her own_ The institution is guided by numerous arcane rules
of discourse that are staggeringly tricky to follow_ For example, if an inmate
wants to speak to somebody, he or she must ring a bell, after which everyone
around will freeze_ Then the person must wait for fifteen seconds to collect
his or her thoughts before addressing anyone_ &#x201c;The theory is that all
these rules will help a liar create a new, stable identity out of some elaborately
constructed fiction,&#x201d; wrote Caryn James in the &lt;em&gt;New York
Times Book Review_&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working within this unsteady environment, Sim tries to decipher the
sanitarium's rules, each one of which turns out to be a clue &#x201c;in a puzzle
whose solution is ultimately immaterial to its beauty&#x201d; as described
by a contributor to the &lt;em&gt;New Yorker_&lt;/em&gt; As Sim tries
to figure out his place in what he identifies as some kind of mastermind scheme,
he also attempts to discover the nature of the &#x201c;plague of deafness&#x201d;
that Samedi has promised to inflict on what he considers to be an ill-mannered
world_&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#x201c;Like the early Thomas Pynchon &#x2026; Mr_ Ball creates a world
nearly identical to ours, which operates on one significantly different principle:
Your most paranoid fears are likely to be true,&#x201d; wrote Caryn James in
the &lt;em&gt;New York Times Book Review_&lt;/em&gt; James also noted
that &#x201c;readers who long for instant clarity will be frustrated,&#x201d;
adding: &#x201c;But anyone with a taste for the elusive will find that this
smart, audacious work becomes as gripping as a good thriller, which it partially
resembles_&#x201d; James further noted that the author wrote &lt;strong&gt;
<em>Samedi the Deafness&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt; in Scotland, where he lived by
a cemetery_ Several of the characters, including Grieve and Lily Violet, were
named after people buried there_&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Praise for Ball's first novel was effusive and widespread_ &#x201c;Poet
Ball uses the language of his trade to breathe life into his inspired thriller
about memory, truth and the unsound constructs in which we house these ethereal
concepts,&#x201d; wrote a &lt;em&gt;Kirkus Reviews&lt;/em&gt; contributor,
who also called the book &#x201c;an unorthodox detective story_&#x201d; Referring
to the novel as &#x201c;highly imaginative,&#x201d; a contributor to <em>Publishers Weekly&lt;/em&gt; commented that the author &#x201c;writes
scenes that read like prose poetry and cultivates a Beckett-like alienated
digression rather than standard plot_&#x201d;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ball's second novel, &lt;strong&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The Way through Doors,&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt; was
described by &lt;em&gt;Blogcritics&lt;/em&gt; Web site writer Bryan
McKay as an &#x201c;inventive and strange little book, toying with the possibilities
of narrative while giving us tantalizingly incomplete glimpses at dozens of
possible fictions_ But even when it appears that the book is ready to disappear
into itself, Ball manages to reign in his story, making sure everything, even
the loose threads, fit together with a certain sort of internal logic_&#x201d;
Although several critics noted that the novel bears a superficial resemblance
to the plot of the movie &lt;em&gt;While You Were Sleeping,&lt;/em&gt; it
quickly moves in its own, highly original direction_ The novel is an experimental
work reminiscent of the works of Franz Kafka and other surrealist writers
in theme and execution_ The work begins with the renowned pamphletist Selah
Morse assuming his job as an inspector in a strangely twisted American city_
The job, explained Minneapolis &lt;em&gt;Star Tribune&lt;/em&gt; reviewer
Ethan Rutherford, &#x201c;allows him to &#x2018;go about the city&#x2019; (the
city being New York, but only in the vaguest sense) and &#x2018;inspect virtually
anything we choose_ Our authority is both unlimited and non-existent_&#x2019;&#x201d;
&#x201c;A few months into this job,&#x201d; Rutherford went on, &#x201c;a woman
is hit by a car; she is physically fine, but her memory seems to be gone_&#x201d;
Morse&#x2014;for reasons Ball never explains&#x2014;takes the woman under his
personal care, poses as her boyfriend, dubs her Mora Klein, and takes her
back to his apartment where he, Scheherazade-like, tells her stories for eighteen
hours straight in order to help her regain her memory_&#x201d; &#x201c;Ball
jumps from one confusing vignette to another,&#x201d; wrote an &lt;em&gt;
America's Intelligence Wire&lt;/em&gt; reviewer, &#x201c;as Selah tries to
rebuild Mora's memory via far-fetched fables_&#x201d; These stories are the
main focus of the novel and they are, according to Julia Keller, writing for
the &lt;em&gt;Chicago Tribune,&lt;/em&gt; &#x201c;disturbingly original_&#x201d; &lt;strong&gt;
<em>The Way through Doors&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt; &#x201c;is a story about the
telling of stories, a narrative about narratives,&#x201d; Keller continued_
&#x201c;It keeps the reader enthralled by constantly taking the wrong fork
in the road_ Stories are tucked inside other stories_&#x201d; &#x201c;&lt;strong&gt;
<em>The Way through Doors,&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&#x201d; McKay concluded, &#x201c;is
about good storytelling, and it would be a dismal failure if Ball were not
a good enough storyteller to keep up with his subject_&#x201d;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#x201c;The writing of &lt;strong&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The Way through Doors,
&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&#x201d; Ball told &lt;em&gt;Bookslut&lt;/em&gt; Web
site interviewer Blake Butler, &#x201c;took two to three weeks_ I had, however,
thought through what some of the various storylines would be_ So, the two
to three weeks consisted of putting it down on paper_ The important thing
for me about the structure of a book is that it should permit me the room
to surprise myself as I write_ Certainly, the structure of &lt;em&gt;
TWTD&lt;/em&gt; allows that_ As for intentions, I don't know that I had particular
intentions that would differentiate my purpose in &lt;em&gt;Samedi&lt;/em&gt; from
that in &lt;em&gt;TWTD_&lt;/em&gt;&#x201d; &#x201c;The act of telling
stories and the act of hearing them are processes and engagements by which
we can understand our human situation_ By that, I don't mean understand factually&#x2014;I
mean intuitively,&#x201d; Ball continued in an interview with a &lt;em&gt;
Porter Square Books Blog&lt;/em&gt; writer_ &#x201c;The main issue, as I see
it, isn't between linear and non-linear narrative_ It's between two types
of rendering: rendering a reality that is already the consensus, or rendering
one that is more precise_&#x201d; &#x201c;It's easier to say what &lt;strong&gt;
<em>The Way through Doors&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt; isn't than what it is_ It isn't
a growing-up story in which the world magically convenes to give the protagonist
wisdom_ It's not a book that says &#x2018;See if you can follow me&#x2019; and
then bamboozles you with plot twists and strange allusions,&#x201d; explained <em>Los Angeles Times Book Review&lt;/em&gt; contributor Laurel Maury_ &#x201c;In
places, it could be deeper_&#x201d; But, Maury continued, the book is &#x201c;written
with a flawless, compassionate ear_ Every strange line of prose feels, somehow,
thoughtful and necessary_&#x201d; &#x201c;&lt;strong&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The Way through
Doors,&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&#x201d; concluded the &lt;em&gt;Porter Square
Books Blog&lt;/em&gt; writer, &#x201c;has the humor, wisdom, and warmth of
our most comfortable stories while radically experimenting with the novel
form and the fluid nature of storytelling_&#x201d;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ball's third novel is, Beggs noted on the &lt;em&gt;Millions&lt;/em&gt; Web
site, a &#x201c;dystopian father-daughter tale set in an unnamed city of the
future where music is outlawed_&#x201d; Beggs allowed that the novel is a &#x201c;quick
and engrossing read&#x2014;not nearly as sci-fi as that description suggests_&#x201d;
The novel features William Drysdale, who has had to give up the violin to
write epitaphs for mourning families, and his eight-year-old daughter, Molly,
motherless and a mute_ They inhabit a chillingly controlled city in a future
police state where weekends have been banned and all artistic performance,
including music, prohibited_ There is, of course, also a strict curfew, and
one night the father breaks the curfew when he gathers with a secret group
of people opposed to the regime_ Meantime, he leaves his daughter with a puppeteer,
Mr_ Gibbons, and those two put on a forbidden puppet play dealing with the
story of Molly's family_&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;em&gt;New Yorker&lt;/em&gt; contributor noted of this work:
&#x201c;What sounds precious in summary astonishes on the page; the reader
is puzzled, charmed, then shattered_&#x201d; &lt;em&gt;New York Times
Book Review&lt;/em&gt; contributor William Giraldi also had high praise for
this work, calling it a &#x201c;spare masterwork of dystopian fiction, a fevered
prose poem of society strangled by nefarious rule,&#x201d; and a &#x201c;tar-dark
fairy tale evokes not a future American city but a social hell from history:
Moscow in 1937, Warsaw in '39_&#x201d; For Giraldi, &#x201c;Ball is a worthy
Virgil through this inferno of our own design_&#x201d; Likewise, Donna Seaman,
writing in &lt;em&gt;Booklist,&lt;/em&gt; commended the &#x201c;solemn
beauty, beguiling invention, and unnerving insights&#x201d; in this &#x201c;haunting
dystopian tale_&#x201d; A &lt;em&gt;Publishers Weekly&lt;/em&gt; reviewer
also had a high assessment of this novel, noting: &#x201c;Ball's ideas and
heart make this a very compelling read_&#x201d; Similarly, a &lt;em&gt;
Kirkus Reviews&lt;/em&gt; contributor concluded: &#x201c;In Ball's delicately
etched nightmare, there's still room in the regime for ordinary comforts like
pea soup&#x2014;trouble is, the spoons are too small_ Mordantly morbid_&#x201d;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The Village on Horseback&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt; collects
Ball's short prose and verse from the first decade of the twenty-first century_
Here Ball, an &#x201c;an extraordinarily unfettered tale-spinner,&#x201d; according
to &lt;em&gt;Booklist&lt;/em&gt; reviewer Seaman, tells of the denizens
of a village who share the same dream, or of a weaver who falls in love with
a murderer, or the inappropriate behavior of four youths that ultimately leads
to duels_&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reviewing gathered writings of &lt;strong&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The Village on
Horseback,&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt; Seaman termed them &#x201c;evocative parables &#x2026;
magical satire, poetic fables, and archetypal mysteries [that] flourish, entrance,
and confound_&#x201d; A &lt;em&gt;Publishers Weekly&lt;/em&gt; contributor
also found this a &#x201c;superb new volume [that] is strange, haunting, and
wise, but hard to characterize_&#x201d;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The narrator of Ball's fourth novel, &lt;strong&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Silence
Once Begun,&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt; is, strangely enough, a writer named Jesse
Ball_ Ball, newly divorced, has taken it upon himself to investigate a crime
that took place near Osaka, Japan, in the mid-1970s_ In what the narrator
refers to as the Narito Disappearances, eight single, middle-aged men and
women, who lived alone and had no apparent connections, mysteriously vanished&#x2014;so
abruptly, in some cases, that food was left on the table in their apartments_
In each case, a playing card was left at the door_ A thread merchant named
Oda Sotatsu was eventually arrested, tried, and hanged for the apparent crimes
largely on the basis of a false confession he signed after he encountered
one Sato Kakuzo and a girl named Jito Joo in a bar_ He and Kakuzo made a bet
requiring the loser to sign a confession, which Kakuzo had brought along and
that Joo would then take to the police_ Sotatsu lost the wager, signed the
confession, and on this basis was convicted_ During his imprisonment, he maintained
virtually complete silence, refusing to defend himself_ The ensuing story
consists of a number of interview transcripts and other documents that narrate
events from the perspective of various peripheral characters, including Sotatsu's
brother, sister, mother, and father, as well as Kakuzo and Joo_ In this regard,
many readers see a similarity between the novel and the influential 1950 Japanese
film, &lt;em&gt;Rashomon,&lt;/em&gt; which is based on the differing
witnesses' accounts of a rape and murder_ In the end, it is never made clear
even whether a crime actually took place, and the overall effect is one of
a miscarriage of justice_ Enhancing the narration are a number of enigmatic
black-and-white photographs, none with captions_&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Critics regarded &lt;strong&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Silence Once Begun&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt; as
a tour de force in its exploration of the elusiveness of truth_ A <em>Publishers Weekly&lt;/em&gt; contributor found the book &#x201c;intriguing&#x201d;
but hinted at a potential weakness in the book by writing: &#x201c;How readers
react to it will largely depend on whether they feel some of the final twists
deepen or cheapen the material_&#x201d; In &lt;em&gt;Booklist,&lt;/em&gt; Donna
Seaman called the book &#x201c;a work of exceptional control and exquisite
nuance&#x201d; and &#x201c;an elegantly chilling and provocatively metaphysical
tale_&#x201d; A critic for &lt;em&gt;Kirkus Reviews&lt;/em&gt; characterized
the novel as a &#x201c;darker but more tempered version of [Ball's] strange,
almost whimsical multimedia creations&#x201d; and praised the &#x201c;fascination
his aberrant storytelling inspires_&#x201d; For &lt;em&gt;Library Journal
&lt;/em&gt;'s Henry Bankhead, &#x201c;This multifaceted narration of a seemingly
inexplicable miscarriage of justice cloaked as a political statement creates
a kind of Brechtian drama; the detached perspective is chilling, though strangely
intriguing_&#x201d; Carolyn Kellogg, in a review for the &lt;em&gt;Los
Angeles Times,&lt;/em&gt; remarked that &#x201c;Ball has built in a few genuinely
surprising twists that exist solely because of how the story is structured_
That's an accomplishment; &lt;strong&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Silence Once Begun&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt; is
a fascinating project in which almost everything is stripped away but the
contradictory stories people tell_&#x201d;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several critics focused on the theme of &lt;strong&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Silence
Once Begun_&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt; In the &lt;em&gt;New York Observer,&lt;/em&gt; for
example, Michael H_ Miller observed: &#x201c;The question of where fact, however
partial, begins and ends&#x2014;the pointless search for the line between truth
and lies&#x2014;becomes a window into the book_ The reader's search for the
meaning of the text becomes as obsessive as the fictional Jesse Ball's quest
for the truth behind the Narito Disappearances_&#x201d; Miller continued: &#x201c;We
are entrenched as the world of the novel blurs everything outside of it, as
if to say stranger things have happened in real life than could ever happen
in a work of fiction_&#x201d; Tobias Carroll, writing for &lt;em&gt;
Time Out New York,&lt;/em&gt; agreed: &#x201c;Throughout, there are many questions
about both what is said and what is left unsaid; motivation, memory and reliability
all come under scrutiny_ Though its structure and language reflect an intellectual
game play, the novel's haunting, final paragraphs form a demonstration of
Ball's authorial thesis, applying notions about unknowability and community
behavior on a grander scale_&#x201d; Carroll concluded: &#x201c;It shifts the
book's stakes: What had been a taut crime story stands revealed as something
much more ominous_&#x201d;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the opening pages of Ball's dystopian novel &lt;strong&gt;
&lt;em&gt;
A Cure for Suicide,&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt; the reader is introduced
to a childlike &#x201c;claimant&#x201d; who is sitting in a chair while he listens
to a female &#x201c;examiner,&#x201d; Teresa, explaining to him how a story
works_ As the novel unfolds, the reader learns that the memory of the claimant&#x2014;at
first named Anders, then Martin, then Henry Caul&#x2014;has been wiped by a
series of injections and that he is slowly relearning everything about the
world, from what a chair is to what dreams and memories are_ The reader further
learns that, according to the examiner, the man had been gravely ill but was
brought to his current location, a Victorian house in a bucolic village, to
recover; his recovery will progress through a sequence of treatments at similar
locales in what is called the Process of Villages_ The only person the claimant
interacts with is his examiner, who teaches him the mechanisms of daily living
but whose identity will shift through the course of the novel_ Although he
has no memory of his life before arriving in the village, he cries out for
someone in his sleep_ In time, the reader will learn that in the aftermath
of the tragic death of the woman he loved, he contemplated suicide and that
his treatment through the Process of Villages is designed to provide him with
a cure; indeed, other claimants have sought similar cures in a world where
suicide has become epidemic_ Matters become complicated when the examiner
brings the man, now named Martin, to a party, where he meets Hilda, who asks
him to meet her in secret and who informs him that the village is not what
it seems&#x2014;that in fact, everything is staged, and most of the people
he encounters are actors_ She claims, too, that both she and the man are in
danger and she urges him to flee with her_ But the following night, when the
two were supposed to meet and make their escape, Hilda fails to appear_ In
this way, the man learns about distrust, and regret_ As fake memories erase
genuine ones, a long flashback to the love affair that ended tragically enhances
the mystery surrounding the claimant's fate_&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;
&lt;em&gt;A Cure for Suicide&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt; was widely
reviewed and just as widely applauded, although a &lt;em&gt;Kirkus Reviews
&lt;/em&gt; contributor had mixed reactions_ Calling the novel a &#x201c;poetically
nimble but characteristically peculiar story,&#x201d; the reviewer offered
this assessment: &#x201c;There are times it feels rushed between the spare,
meticulous play going on between the claimant and the examiner and other breathless
sections with unbroken waves of narrative exposition&#x2014;the shift in tones
can be jarring_ This may be Ball's most self-contained work, but it's also
one of his most fragile and one that may not hold up under focused scrutiny
by a wider audience_&#x201d; In contrast, Maddie Crum, writing for the <em>Huffington Post,&lt;/em&gt; remarked that &#x201c;Ball's novel is an
enthralling thought experiment that considers the value of memory versus the
pain of grief_ Fans of dystopian stories and themes involving memory will
relish this magical novel_&#x201d; A &lt;em&gt;Publishers Weekly&lt;/em&gt; reviewer,
calling the novel &#x201c;a puzzle box and a haunting love story,&#x201d; concluded:
&#x201c;Whatever the source of this book's elusive magic, it should cement
Ball's reputation as a technical innovator whose work delivers a powerful
emotional impact_&#x201d; Andrew Martin, writing for the &lt;em&gt;New
Yorker,&lt;/em&gt; observed that &#x201c;Ball's disorienting novel takes its
time revealing the scope of its philosophical concerns, but it rewards patience&#x201d;;
Martin concluded: &#x201c;When the novel unveils some of its secrets, the result
is unexpectedly moving_&#x201d; Sarah Gerard, writing in the &lt;em&gt;
New York Times,&lt;/em&gt; called the novel &#x201c;elegant&#x201d; and &#x201c;spellbinding,&#x201d;
as well as &#x201c;subtle and breathtaking_&#x201d; Gerard further commented:
&#x201c;With the simplicity of a fable and the drama of a psychological thriller,
Ball tells a story about starting over from nothing, reconstructing life from
its most basic elements_ These acts of narrative deconstruction highlight
his strength as a deeply questioning writer at home in fact as much as abstraction_&#x201d;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similar judgments were rendered by other reviewers_ Laura Collins-Hughes,
writing for the &lt;em&gt;Boston Globe,&lt;/em&gt; found the novel &#x201c;magnetic,
suspenseful, occasionally heart-rending&#x201d; and praised it for its &#x201c;hypnotic
power_&#x201d; &lt;em&gt;NPR&lt;/em&gt;'s Jason Sheehan lauded the book
as a &#x201c;beautiful mystery&#x201d; the author &#x201c;artfully constructed_&#x201d;
Charles Finch, writing for the &lt;em&gt;Chicago Tribune,&lt;/em&gt; found
the novel &#x201c;hushed, enigmatic and intermittently remarkable&#x201d; and
singled out for praise the extended flashback about the claimant's earlier
life: &#x201c;This turns out to be a love story about a penniless man and a
rich, dying woman, and it's one of the finest things Ball has ever written,
a magical, gripping burst of emotional history, which interrogates the book's
ultimate subject, suicide and the desire for oblivion_&#x201d; Eric Swedlund,
writing for &lt;em&gt;Paste,&lt;/em&gt; was of the opinion that &#x201c;Ball
handles his intriguing premise with subtlety and authority, marching his plot
through the momentous consequences&#x2014;unexpected and inherent&#x2014;of
a truly life-altering decision_&#x201d; M_ John Harrison, in a review for the <em>London Guardian,&lt;/em&gt; found the novel &#x201c;beautifully written
and enticingly macabre,&#x201d; a view seconded by &lt;em&gt;Big Issue
&lt;/em&gt; Web site reviewer Jane Graham, who called the book &#x201c;a dexterous
thing,&#x201d; adding that &#x201c;its sure-footed strangeness is set from the
first page, and from then on it's pretty much irresistible_&#x201d; Graham
further noted that Ball &#x201c;can hit you between the eyes with the most
affecting of revelations without ever veering into sentimentality_&#x201d;
Finally, Owen Richardson, writing for the &lt;em&gt;Sydney Morning Herald,
&lt;/em&gt; noted that &#x201c;Ball's prose is careful and elegant, with moments
of freeze-dried lyricism_ The tone is formal, reserved: there is no slang
in the narration or the dialogue, and little or nothing to suggest American
provenance_&#x201d; Richardson concluded about the novel: &#x201c;Beyond the
narrative games it achieves a beauty of a kind; pathos even_ It repays a second
reading_&#x201d;&lt;/p&gt;
