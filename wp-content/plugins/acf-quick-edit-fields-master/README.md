Docs
----

A note on sortable Columns: Sorting works over a meta query. As a result, items
with no ACF-Value will disappear from the list. To adjust or suppress sortability
for a specific field use `acf_quick_edit_sortable_column_{$field_name}` filter.

------------

 - Download `acf-quick-edit-fields.zip` from the [releases](../../releases/latest) tab.
 - Install it like a regular WordPress plugin.
 - As long as the plugin is active it will check for Updates here on GitHub.
